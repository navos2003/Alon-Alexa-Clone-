# ALON-Virtual-Assistant

I created a clone of Alexa during a hackathon using Python. I have used Python libraries to implement functions like alarms, timers, weather info, jokes and etc. This program works best on Mac since I had built this on a Mac and it is not really optimized for windows. If there you have any errors setting it up or you are not sure on how to set it up please reach out to me on here or my linkedin.
